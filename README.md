# SDG Assignment #7 : 02 - 03 - First Bank of Suncoast

Create your own personal bank account manager. You will be creating an app that will let you track both a savings account and a checking account total by performing transactions, such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers. The application will also save your information in a file so you can track your account totals over time.
